Visitors standing on the rim of the canyon can see down to the canyon floor a mile below, and look out over the ridges and cliffs that run as far as the eye can see. The South Rim is the most visited section of Grand Canyon National Park, with a large visitors center, regular bus service along the Rim in the high season, and a walkway that runs along the canyon with numerous viewing points and platforms. The North Rim, which also has lookout areas, provides a different perspective. This section of the park has limited access from November to May due to snow and winter conditions.',

The water from Lake Erie flows into Lake Ontario over these massive waterfalls, known for the great quantity of water that is constantly tumbling over the vertical drop. The amount of water going over the falls is actually reduced in winter, when more water is used to produce hydroelectric power. Most visitors will not notice a difference. Niagara Falls is actually a set of three falls, consisting of the largest section known as Horseshoe Falls, a second section on the American side of the river known as the American Falls, and a much thinner section located next to the American Falls, known as Bridal Veil Falls. On clear days, the plume of mist rising from Niagara Falls can be seen from as far away as the CN Tower in downtown Toronto, Canada, on the opposite shore of Lake Ontario.',

The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty (618–907) and Northern Song Dynasty (960–1127) completed the Four Great Inventions. Tang culture spread widely in Asia, as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa. The Qing Empire, China\'s last dynasty, suffered heavy losses to foreign imperialism. The Chinese monarchy collapsed in 1912 with the 1911 Revolution, when the Republic of China (ROC) replaced the Qing dynasty. China was invaded by the Empire of Japan during World War II. The Chinese Civil War resulted in a division of territory in 1949 when the CCP led by Mao Zedong established the People\'s Republic of China on mainland China while the Kuomintang-led ROC government retreated to the island of Taiwan. Both the PRC and the ROC currently claim to be the sole legitimate government of China, resulting in an ongoing dispute even after the United Nations recognized the PRC as the government to represent China at all UN conferences in 1971.<br>Since the establishment of the People\'s Republic of China in 1949, China has been a unitary one-party socialist republic, and is one of the few remaining socialist states. The country is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since replacing the ROC in 1971. China is a founding member of several multilateral and regional cooperation organizations such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the New Development Bank, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, and is a member of the BRICS nations and the East Asia Summit. It ranks among the lowest in international measurements of civil liberties, government transparency, freedom of the press, freedom of religion and ethnic minorities. The Chinese government practises mass censorship and mass surveillance of its citizens. Chinese authorities have been criticized by political dissidents and human rights activists for widespread human rights abuses, including political repression and violent suppression of protests.<br>After economic reforms in 1978, and its entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, China\'s economy became the second-largest country by nominal GDP in 2010 and grew to the largest in the world by PPP in 2014. China is the world\'s fastest-growing major economy, the second-wealthiest nation in the world, and the world\'s largest manufacturer and exporter. The nation has the world\'s largest standing army—the People\'s Liberation Army—the second-largest defense budget, and is a recognized nuclear-weapons state. China has been characterized as an emerging superpower due to its large economy and powerful military.',

        name: 'The Great Wall of China',
        description: '"Nobody can be a true hero unless he has been on the Great Wall" goes the popular Chinese saying, one that clearly demonstrates the importance placed upon this unique ancient monument. The magnificent Great Wall of China (known in Chinese as "Changcheng," or the "Long Wall") stretches more than 6,000 kilometers from the fortresses of Shanhaiguan in the east all the way to Jiayuguan in the west, passing through Hebei, Tientsin, Beijing — where the best preserved sections of the wall can be visited —Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, and Gansu.<br>Averaging six to eight meters in height but rising as high as 16 meters — and wide enough in places for five horses or 10 men to pass — the wall boasts numerous battlements and watchtowers, some dating back as far as the 7th century BC, with the best-known areas added around 210 BC when its various sections were joined. Today, the most visited section of the wall is near Badaling Pass northwest of Beijing, easily reached by public transport or organized tours. Other restored sections worth a visit include the section near Gubeikou, 130 kilometers from Beijing, and in Mutianyu, just 70 kilometers northeast of Beijing.',

        name: 'The Forbidden City and the Imperial Palace, Beijing',
        description: 'China\'s largest and most important building, the Forbidden City — also known as the Imperial Palace — is situated in the very heart of Beijing and is a must-see when visiting the country. Started during the Yuan Dynasty between 1271-1368, much of the complex seen today (it\'s really many splendid palaces in one) was built between 1406 and 1420 as the residence of 24 Ming and Qing Emperors, whose presence forbade the entry of anyone other than the imperial family and their courtesans.<br>Covering some 720,000 square meters and protected by a 10-meter-high wall with watchtowers and a wide moat, this massive complex consists of areas set aside for ceremonial and administrative purposes, as well as a private residence used by the emperor. While it can take many hours to see everything, highlights include the five white marble Golden River Bridges; the Hall of Supreme Harmony, a 35-meter-tall building housing the imperial throne; the exquisite emperor\'s banquet hall (the Hall of Preserving Harmony); and the Palace Museum with its large collection of art and artifacts from the Ming and Qing dynasties, to name but a few. Other important attractions in the vicinity of the Imperial Palace include famous Tiananmen Square, and the Temple of Heaven, one of the country\'s most important religious sites, which dates back to the 15th century.',

        description: 'It was while digging wells on the outskirts of Xi\'an in the 1970s that farmers stumbled across what was to be China\'s most important archeological find: the Terracotta Army. Distributed over three large underground pits and built to guard the First Emperor\'s tomb were more than 8,000 life-size warriors, some 520 horses, and more than 100 chariots, along with numerous other non-military characters dating from around 280 BC. Although some were severely damaged due to the passing of time, many of the statues unearthed have been painstakingly re-assembled and stand as testament to the importance bestowed upon the emperor and the afterlife. The site — part of the Emperor Qin Shi Huang\'s Mausoleum Site Park — is one of China\'s most important tourist destinations and offers the unforgettable experience of standing in front of this assembly of soldiers and horses as if inspecting a centuries-old parade.',

        description: 'An easy 15-kilometer commute from Beijing, the sumptuous Imperial Summer Palace (Yíhé Yuán) is set amid more than 700 acres of beautiful parkland and is one of China\'s most visited attractions. While the palace itself was built in 1153, its large lake was added in the 14th century to enhance the Imperial Gardens. Highlights include the magnificent Hall of Well-being and Longevity (Renshou Dian) with its throne, and the beautiful Great Theatre, a private three-story structure built in 1891 to satisfy the imperial family\'s love of opera and still used for performances of traditional Chinese plays and musical events. Other highlights include the Hall of Happiness and Longevity (Le Shou Tang Hall), with its lovely gardens and courtyards, as well as many miles of picturesque pathways and walking trails. If time allows, try to also take in the ruins of the Old Summer Palace, said to have once been one of the country\'s most elaborate and architecturally attractive palaces, but which was sadly destroyed by colonial forces in the mid-1800s.',

While for hundreds of years this unique scenery has attracted poets and artists and has been the subject of countless fairy tales and legends, these days it\'s popular with tourists from around the world wanting to see this natural splendor up close.<br>The best way to enjoy the area is to take a cruise along the Li River. The most popular stretch is from Guilin to Yangshuo, where the river meanders peacefully through some 80 kilometers of remarkable rock formations and caves with romantic names such as the Mount of Unique Beauty, Elephant Trunk Hill, and Reed Flute Cave. Depending upon the type of boat used — you can choose from a tourist cruise ship to small bamboo punts — trips can take anywhere from a few hours to multiple days.',

        description: 'No visit to China would be complete without at least one panda experience. While the country\'s top zoos boast many fine specimens of these fascinating creatures, the best place to see them in a close approximation to their natural habitat is at the excellent Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding in Chengdu, located in the province of Sichuan. Here, you\'ll have the chance to watch as many as 80 pandas go about their daily routines, from foraging to playing in the facility\'s large park-like setting.<br>In addition to viewing these splendid animals up close, you\'ll learn a great deal about them from the many permanent exhibits and displays detailing ongoing conservation efforts to safeguard their future. English language tours are available. If possible, try to time your visit for the morning feeding sessions when the pandas are at their most active; better still, sign-up for one of the unique experiential volunteer programs that will have you involved in the feeding and care of these cuddly creatures... and possibly even holding a baby panda.',

        description: 'Known in China as Chang Jiang ("Long River"), the mighty Yangtze River extends more than 6,000 kilometers, making it the longest and most important river in China and the third longest in the world after the Amazon and the Nile. Flowing from Tibet in the west to Shanghai in the east through eight provinces, the Yangtze has, for more than 2,000 years, been China\'s major transportation route (some 2,700 kilometers are navigable). Its vast catchment area, with its 700 tributaries, cover about one-fifth of the total area of the country and encompass a quarter of the country\'s agricultural land.<br>While its immense length ensures the river can be visited at numerous points in China, by far the most popular for tourists is the beautiful Three Gorges — Qutang, Wu, and Xiling — a 200-kilometer stretch between the towns of Fengjie and Yichang. In places a mix of raging torrents and dangerous shallows, here the river winds its way through the gorges and their rugged cliffs and high mountain peaks in a stretch of scenery as dramatic as the Grand Canyon. Numerous sightseeing options are available, from luxurious riverboat cruises focusing on the region\'s many historical attractions and places of scenic beauty to challenging adventure tours along the most dramatic sections of the river.',
